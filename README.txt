Included is screensaver software designed for current Apple Macintosh OS X operating systems.--

To install, double-click the .saver file. This opens the System Preferences Desktop & Screen Saver pane and asks to install the software. Click INSTALL. Then, sit back and do nothing—the screensaver will start soon enough.

If you get this error: “... can’t be opened because it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store.” Then open your System Preferences and navigate to “Security and Privacy” > “General” and under “Allow apps downloaded from:” select “Mac App Store and identified developers”.
All softwares are programmed by O-R-G and are also available online at http://www.o-r-g.com.
