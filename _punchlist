+ add tips to sticks (capsule now, could do cone-cylinder-cone)
+ drop from perpendicular or parallel
x sticks to be still after drop? (physics)
+ open multiple copies (for testing) in terminal   
+ add tips to sticks by adding cones to cylinder ends as node children

+ remove sticks one at a time over some period, when finished, drop again
  render loop (see ray wenderlich tutorial
  2.5 seconds per before disappear
  3:33 / 40 for entire sequence
+ catch if any sticks remain before removing
+ after run out of sticks, then re-drop (repopulate sticks)
  keep animation running or restart when needed better (see geometryfighter)
+ review actions logic on sticks
+ better solid, no fade in fade out?
+ review and improve timeouts in renderloop delegate
x stix thicker
- gradually slow down sticks rolling before pickup
- two monitors, opengl / metal performance issues
