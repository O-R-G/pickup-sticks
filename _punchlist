+ add tips to sticks (capsule now, could do cone-cylinder-cone)
+ drop from perpendicular or parallel
x sticks to be still after drop? (physics)
+ open multiple copies (for testing) in terminal   
+ add tips to sticks by adding cones to cylinder ends as node children

  more-scngeometry-scnnode-into-one
+ remove sticks one at a time over some period, when finished, drop again
  render loop (see ray wenderlich tutorial
  2.5 seconds per before disappear
  3:33 / 40 for entire sequence
+ catch if any sticks remain before removing
+ after run out of sticks, then re-drop (repopulate sticks)
  keep animation running or restart when needed better (see geometryfighter)
+ review actions logic on sticks
+ better solid, no fade in fade out?
+ review and improve timeouts in renderloop delegate
x thicker stix
x drop and disappear cld last 3:33? ~5,5 seconds per stick removal
+ remove the top most stick
  sort with closure function on presentation world position y
x gradually slow down sticks rolling before pickup
+ less 3d? (adjusted position of spot light)
+ .dmg release candidate 1
+ drop speed and timing refine
x two monitors, opengl / metal performance issues
x stopPhysics using changing type to static instead of dynamic 
- preview icon xcode?
- .dmg release candidate 2
